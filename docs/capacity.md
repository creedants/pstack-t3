# Capacity of this machine

Forty idle Haiku agents fit on this host on 2026-10-05, with 5.9 GiB of memory still available. A rerun later that morning held forty Haiku agents again and ran four copies of this repo's build and unit suite. Each copy completed one passing iteration during the sample window. A heavier follow-up, four copies of the unit suite with no pause, also completed one passing iteration per copy. Swap, load, and the root HTTP probe stayed inside the stop lines. Both runs stopped because the plan stopped, with memory still available.

## Hardware

The CPU is an AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS, 8 cores and 16 threads, with a max clock of 4830 MHz. `nproc` is 16.

MemTotal is 27421264 KiB, 26.2 GiB. The 2026-10-04 estimate calls this machine 26 GB of RAM. SwapTotal is 54842712 KiB, 52.3 GiB.

The machine had been up for about 2 days at both baselines.

## What was measured

`scripts/measure_capacity.py` prints one TSV row per sample. It uses the Python standard library only.

Memory used is MemTotal minus MemAvailable, in KiB. MemAvailable is what the kernel will give a new allocation without swapping. Swap used is SwapTotal minus SwapFree. `load1` is the first field of `/proc/loadavg`. `psi_full_avg10` is the 10-second full memory-stall average from `/proc/pressure/memory`.

The responsiveness probe is one HTTP GET of `/` on 127.0.0.1. It measures that root HTML response only. It does not measure any other T3 operation. The process is the `t3code` command line that contains `bin.mjs` and does not contain `acp-mcp-bridge`. On these runs the port was 3773. `probe_ok` is 1 when the status is 200 and the body starts with `<!doctype html>`. The timeout is 5 seconds.

`sessions` counts a live process from the NUL-separated arguments in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`. The basename of argv[0] is `grok` and argv[1] is `agent`, or the basename of argv[0] is `claude` and a later element is `--model` or begins with `--model=`. An argv[0] value that contains whitespace has no argument boundary, so it does not count. `claude-desktop` and the `codex` app-server hosts do not match those basenames. A shell whose script text only mentions these words counts zero.

`build_procs` counts a Python process whose argv[1] is `scripts/build.py` or `scripts/run_tests.py`, or a path ending in `/scripts/build.py` or `/scripts/run_tests.py`, or whose argv[1] is `-m` and argv[2] is `unittest`. A direct exec of one of those scripts counts too. One run of `scripts/run_tests.py` counts its runner and each worker or listing child it has alive, so a run at `-j 4` counts 5 while its four workers are alive. A test that starts one of those scripts itself adds to the count while it runs. A shell whose script text only mentions those strings counts zero. The count shows that those processes existed. Exit status in the loop log is what shows that an iteration passed. The idle-ramp table is the exception. Its `sessions` and `build_procs` cells came from the older substring counter, which that section names.

Each official step is five samples, five seconds apart.

```bash
python3 skills/landing/scripts/land.py slot --exclusive -- python3 scripts/measure_capacity.py --label <name> --samples 5 --interval 5
```

The exclusive slot holds every governor slot for the duration of that command, so other governed builds and tests wait. `load1` is a one-minute average, so five samples inside one minute are not five independent load readings. The median is the summary.

Stop a ramp when swap used exceeds half of swap total, or when a probe fails or takes longer than 2000 ms. A step is past the line this run treated as degradation when MemAvailable drops under 1 GiB, when `load1` exceeds 16, or when the probe median is both over 100 ms and over five times the baseline median.

## Idle agents on the first ramp

The agents were T3 child tasks on provider `claudeAgent`, model `claude-haiku-4-5`, with thinking set to false. The catalog also has Cursor `gpt-5.4-nano` with reasoning `none`. This measurement used Haiku, because the Claude driver was already starting sessions on this host.

The pilot was asked to run `sleep 2400` and to do nothing else. The harness refused a standalone sleep. The Claude process stayed after the turn ended. The other 39 were asked to reply with the single word idle and not to use tools. Their processes stayed too. Samples for 10, 20, and 40 started about 60 seconds after the new processes were up.

The baseline already included other work. Workers were running in the `pstack-t3-d1` and `pstack-t3-d2` worktrees. The baseline `sessions` value is 8. After the baseline, the background session count dropped by one and held. The later counts are 17, 27, and 47, which is that background plus 10, 20, and 40 Haiku processes.

Those `sessions` and `build_procs` cells were produced by an older counter that searched the command text for substrings. The memory, swap, load, and probe columns are kernel and HTTP readings, and a review checked their arithmetic. The idle-10 row whose `build_procs` cell is 2 is a substring match. It is not evidence that a build ran. The first attempt's four-loop rows are omitted here. That counter could not show that the loops were the processes it counted, and the loops left no exit status.

| Step | Memory used KiB | Available KiB | Swap used KiB | load1 | Probe ms | Sessions | Build procs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | 15949180 | 11472084 | 2276392 | 1.64 | 1.7 | 8 | 0 |

| idle-40 | 21234544 | 6186720 | 2505096 | 1.25 | 1.6 | 47 | 0 |

Every `probe_ok` value in these rows was 1. Every `psi_full_avg10` value was 0.00.

From the baseline median to the idle-40 median, available memory fell by 5285364 KiB. Dividing by the 40 added agents gives 132134 KiB, which is 129 MiB. That 129 MiB figure is this ramp's average net change in MemAvailable. It is not a measured cost of one more agent, and it does not set a ceiling. The per-step averages were 148 MiB at 10 agents and 145 MiB at 20. The average fell as the count rose. Nothing in this run measured shared file pages, so that drop stays unexplained. A snapshot of anonymous RSS taken just after the idle-40 samples is a different number and is not used here.

Swap grew by 228704 KiB, 223 MiB, from 4.2 percent to 4.6 percent. The stop line is 50 percent. `load1` at idle-40 was 1.25, range 1.14 to 1.36. The probe median stayed at 1.6 ms, range 0.7 to 6.1. One idle-10 probe sample was 56.5 ms. The other four were 0.7, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.6 ms.

RAM is the resource that moved. At 40 agents, 5.9 GiB was still available. The step count was the bound of the test.

While the last 20 agents were still starting, two curls of the same root URL, outside the sampler, took 148 ms and 90 ms. The idle-40 samples, taken after a 60 second wait, were back near 1 ms.

A projection, not a measurement. Another 39 agents at 129 MiB of MemAvailable each would put available memory near 1 GiB. This ramp did not start them.

## Forty agents with builds on the rerun

The rerun used the same agent method. Forty child tasks, provider `claudeAgent`, model `claude-haiku-4-5`, thinking false, asked to reply with the single word idle and not to use tools. The new baseline below was taken before those tasks existed. Forty `claude` processes whose arguments contained `haiku` were up, the root probe was checked, and the samples started about 60 seconds later.

The four loops ran in four copies of the tree, so they did not write this worktree. Each loop was started with `LAND_SLOT` unset. The first workload ran `python3 scripts/build.py` and then `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`, with no pause, and appended one unbuffered status line per finished iteration. The sample window is the first sample timestamp through the last. An iteration counts when its end timestamp falls inside that window.

The builds-4 window was 2026-10-05T02:31:53Z through 02:32:13Z. Each of the four loops completed one iteration in that window. Every `build_exit` was 0 and every `unittest_exit` was 0. The suite log for each copy says `Ran 85 tests` and `OK`, in 32.384 to 32.526 seconds. `build_procs` was 4 on every row.

The suite-4 window was 2026-10-05T02:32:38Z through 02:32:58Z. Each loop ran only the unit suite, again with no pause. Each completed one iteration in the window, `unittest_exit` 0, `Ran 85 tests` and `OK`, in 32.771 to 32.789 seconds. `build_procs` was 4 on the first three rows and 5 on the last two. The fifth process was not a fifth completed loop.

Every `probe_ok` value was 1. Every `psi_full_avg10` value was 0.00.

One reading 60 seconds after the 40 Haiku processes were up, and before the loops started, showed 6054728 KiB available, swap still 4122676 KiB, `load1` 2.40, 49 sessions, and 0 build processes. The builds-4 available median is 6074972 KiB, 20 MiB from that reading. The drop from the rerun baseline happened when the agents arrived. The four running suites did not take a further bite that shows up between that reading and the builds-4 median.

From the rerun baseline median to the builds-4 median, available memory fell 5240288 KiB. Forty Haiku processes were the processes that had been added. Dividing the drop by 40 gives 128 MiB. That is this rerun's average net change, the same kind of figure as the first ramp's 129 MiB. Swap grew 1617584 KiB, 1.54 GiB, from 4.6 percent to 7.5 percent, and that growth was already present before the loops started. During both build windows swap stayed at 4122676 KiB.

`load1` during builds-4 had median 3.84 and range 3.35 to 4.17. During suite-4 the median was 4.62 and the range was 4.33 to 4.84. The suite window started less than a minute after the first loops stopped, so its `load1` still overlaps that earlier work. Sixteen threads were not full. `psi_full_avg10` stayed 0.00.

The builds-4 probe median was 2.2 ms, range 1.5 to 5.3. The suite-4 median was 3.7 ms. One suite sample was 27.5 ms and the other four were 1.4, 5.6, 1.7, and 3.7 ms. All of them were the root HTML response.

Available memory's median was 706480 KiB higher in the suite-4 window than in the builds-4 window. Swap did not change. This run did not isolate which process released that memory.

At builds-4, 5.8 GiB was still available. Swap was 7.5 percent. The stop line is 50 percent. The lowest available sample in the rerun was 6044556 KiB, still above 1 GiB.

## Comparison with the 2026-10-04 estimate

The estimate was about 40 idle agents, or about 25 agents with 4 builds running, on 26 GB of RAM.

Forty idle Haiku agents on the first ramp had 5.9 GiB available, swap at 4.6 percent, `load1` at 1.25, and the root probe at 1.6 ms. The rerun held 40 Haiku processes plus four running unit suites with 5.8 GiB available, swap at 7.5 percent, `load1` at 3.84, and the root probe at 2.2 ms. Both points are inside the stop lines. They are the top step that was run, not a measured ceiling. The root probe says the HTML endpoint answered. It does not say that interactive T3 use stayed responsive.

The 129 MiB figure is the first ramp's average net change in available memory across 40 added agents. The rerun's matching average is 128 MiB. Neither one was measured as the cost of a single extra agent, and neither one was checked against shared file pages. Using 129 MiB to project a 1 GiB floor at about 79 agents remains a projection. Those agents were not started.

The estimate's figure of about 25 agents with 4 builds describes a heavier build than `scripts/build.py` plus this unit suite. Each suite here took about 33 seconds and passed 85 tests. Four of them left `load1` under 5 on 16 threads and did not move swap during the window. That does not confirm the estimate, and it does not refute it. A heavier build would be a different measurement. Cursor `gpt-5.4-nano` with reasoning `none` was not measured.

## Concurrent runs of the test runner

On 2026-10-10 one to four copies of `python3 scripts/run_tests.py` ran at once on this machine, and four copies ran at `-j 2`. The checkout was `pstack-t3/d138` at `035988f` with this change's edit to `scripts/measure_capacity.py` in the tree, the suite had 1,346 tests, and the interpreter was Python 3.12.15. All 28 runs exited 0 and printed `Ran 1346 tests` and `OK`. No test was lost and no worker timed out.

### Method

A script outside the repository started K copies together from one checkout, each as `python3 scripts/run_tests.py -j J` with its own output file. It recorded each copy's wall time from the start of the group to the copy's exit, and ran `scripts/measure_capacity.py` with `--interval 10` for the same window. Each group ran under one `land.py slot --`, so it held one governor slot while it used K times J workers. It did not use `--exclusive`, so other agents' slotted commands could run beside every step.

Each configuration ran twice. The sampler's output was lost in round 1 because it was block-buffered when the script stopped it, so round 1 has wall times and exit statuses only. The sampler now flushes each row. Round 2 has both. Before each step of round 2 the script waited up to 120 seconds, 15 seconds for the last step, for `load1` to reach 5 or less. It started at a `load1` of 4.8 to 4.9 in the first four steps and 14.9 in the last.

### What else was running

The machine was not quiet. At the start of the round 2 steps of 2, 3, and 4 runs, and of the `-j 2` step, the process list held one other `python3 -m unittest tests.test_*` command, and the 1-run step held none. The `sessions` column read 8 to 10 in the first four steps and rose to 21 during the `-j 2` step. About 4.5 minutes into that step `build_procs` rose from 13 or 14 to 19. It read 18 or 19 until the last minute, then 25, 31, and 27 in three samples, and 10 in the last. Near the end `ps` listed workers of another worktree's `scripts/run_tests.py`. From the rise to the end, 61% of the step, the column counted five or six processes that were not this step's.

### Wall time

Wall time is the time from the start of the group to the exit of its last copy. Suites per hour is K times 3600 over that time. The slowdown is the step's wall time over the 1-run step's in the same round.

| Concurrent runs | `-j` | Workers | Round 1 wall | Round 2 wall | Round 1 suites per hour | Round 2 suites per hour | Round 2 slowdown |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | 4 | 224.6 s | 217.0 s | 16.0 | 16.6 | 1.00 |
| 2 | 4 | 8 | 287.6 s | 266.1 s | 25.0 | 27.1 | 1.23 |

Every `probe_ok` value was 1. The `load1` of other work is inside these numbers.

### What the numbers show

Four runs at `-j 4` ran 16 workers on 16 threads and 8 cores. Their `load1` median was 19.2, above the 16 line this document uses for degradation. Three runs, 12 workers, had a median of 15.0 and a maximum of 17.2.

A third run added 9% to throughput in round 2 and 20% in round 1. A fourth added 7% in round 2 and 9% in round 1, and in round 2 each run took 2.1 times as long as a run alone. Memory did not run short. MemAvailable stayed above 9.7 GiB in every sample, and swap used rose from 4.4 to 5.1 GiB over the five steps.

Four runs at `-j 2` and two at `-j 4` both used eight workers. Round 1 gave 26.3 suites per hour for the first and 25.0 for the second, and round 2 gave 27.1 for the second. Round 2 of the first, with those extra processes beside it, gave 20.9. Round 1 has no samples, so what else ran beside it is unknown. This is one pair of points. It does not show how `-j` and the slot count trade off at other worker totals.

Probe maxima of 459 to 1327 ms stayed under the 2000 ms stop line. A maximum of 961 ms also appeared in the 1-run step, so a single slow probe is not specific to the larger steps. The probe median rose from 3.2 to 6.8 ms between 3 and 4 runs.

Each round ran the steps in the order one run, two, three, four, then four at `-j 2`, between 17:17 and 18:25 local time on one day. These times are for a suite of 1,346 tests.
