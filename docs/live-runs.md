# Live runs

This page records each live end-to-end run of a long pstack-t3 playbook on a real repository. It lists what merged, how long the run took, and the skill defects the run exposed. Each defect becomes its own ticket. A run changes no skill.

## Autopilot-full, 2026-10-06

### Setup

- **T3 build.** `0.0.46-nightly.20261005.2702` on Linux.
- **pstack-t3.** `main` at `c768f78`, pstack 0.15.15.
- **Repository.** `creedants/pstack-t3-sandbox`, a private scratch repository with one Python module, `stats.py`. CI runs `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` on Python 3.12. It allows squash merges only and deletes branches on merge.
- **Queue.** Four issues, one PR each:
  1. `median` returns the upper middle value for even-length input.
  2. `mode` should raise a clear error on empty input.
  3. Add `variance` and `stdev`.
  4. Add a `python -m stats` command line. It depends on #3.
- **Launch.** One root thread on Claude Opus 5.5 in the project root, started with `$poteto-mode full autopilot`. The message named the four issues and gave full autonomy to merge on a clean verdict. The operator answered no question during the run, because the playbook asked none.

### What happened

The root resolved roles with `roles.py show`, chose `gh` as the forge, and wrote an owner brief and a verifier brief to its state directory. Within three minutes it launched three owners with `t3_thread_launch`. Each owner ran Grok 4.7 Build Fast in its own worktree off `main`. The root held #4 until #3 merged and armed the hourly audit tick with `schedule_task`.

Each owner opened a ready PR with a red test within five minutes of launch, linked it with `link_pull_request`, and waited on CI with `watch_pull_request`. For every round, the root ran four `delegate_task` verifiers at the reported head. Each verifier ran on a model family other than Grok:

| Lane | Model |
| --- | --- |
| Gates | GPT-6.1-Sol |
| Live and regression against `main` | Claude Opus 5.5 |
| Spec parity with `statistics` | Gemini 3.8 Flash |
| Robustness | Composer 2.5 |

| Issue | PR | Rounds | Merged (UTC) | Minutes from launch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1 | #6 | 1 | 10:56 | 13 |
| #2 | #5 | 1 | 10:59 | 16 |
| #3 | #7 | 3 | 11:13 | 30 |
| #4 | #8 | 4 so far | Open | Over 99 |

The verifiers caught real defects before merge:

- **#3, round 1.** `variance` and `stdev` called `len()` first, so a generator raised `TypeError`. Three lanes on three models found it independently.
- **#3, round 2.** The fix caught every `StatisticsError` and relabelled errors that the caller's own generator raised. Only the live lane found it. The spec lane passed that head.
- **#4, rounds 1 to 4.** Very large numbers and undecodable stdin ended in a Python traceback. `mean` printed `inf` with exit 0 on input that `statistics.mean` handles. Later rounds found wrong error labels, an integer padded with leading zeros that lost precision, and whole numbers in non-ASCII digits that lost precision. After round 2 the root asked for a redesign of the token parser instead of another patch.

The merge of #2 put #3's open branch in conflict with `main`. The root cancelled that round's verifiers with `task_cancel` and had the owner rebase. It started a fresh round on the new head. Every merge came from a head rebased onto `main`, with CI green on that head and a patch-id equal to the verdict's. The hourly tick fired once at 11:45 and found nothing stuck.

### State at the end of the record

This record stops at 12:22 UTC, 99 minutes after launch, at the end of the observer's timebox. The run was still progressing, so the observer did not stop it.

- `main` is at `3bdc46c` with #1, #2, and #3. CI passed on it.
- Issues #1, #2, and #3 are closed by their PRs. Issue #4 is open.
- PR #8 is open at its round 4 head. At 12:21 the root sent the owner round 4's verdict, not clean, with a precision finding on whole numbers in non-ASCII digits. The owner was fixing it for round 5.
- The only remote branches are `main` and the #4 branch.

The run had launched 61 threads by then. That count is the root, 4 owners, 40 verifier children in 10 rounds, and 16 children the owners started. The root cancelled one round of verifiers when its head went stale. The owner children were 5 Comment Sicko reviews, 3 trail reviews, 1 explanation, 5 design runners, 1 design judge, and 1 implementation child.

### Defects found

1. **Autopilot-full names no channel between owners and the root.** Steps 2, 4, and 5 of `t3/overrides/poteto-mode/playbooks/autopilot-full.md` have owners report the code-ready head, merge-ready, and the merge, and have the root send verdicts. They do not say how. An owner is a top-level thread with no parent, so its finished turn never wakes the root. The runtime's Top-level threads section (`t3/runtime.md`, lines 175 to 193) does not say so either. The root invented a protocol of one-line `CODE-READY`, `MERGE-READY`, `MERGE-PREP`, and `MERGED` messages, sent with `t3_thread_send` and `mode: "queue"`. It sent verdicts the same way with `mode: "auto"`. That protocol worked, but another root may not invent it. **Fix.** Write that protocol into step 2 with the root's thread ID in each owner brief. State in the runtime that a launched thread's turns do not wake the launcher.
2. **The build drops the exec bit on `watch-pr`.** `scripts/build.py` copies files with `shutil.copyfile` and then marks only `.sh`, `.py`, `.mjs`, and `orch.ts` files executable (lines 120 to 122). `vendor/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/scripts/watch-pr/watch-pr` is mode `100755`, and the built copy is `100644`. Step 6 of `t3/overrides/poteto-mode/playbooks/babysit.md` says to run it directly. Running `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/watch-pr/watch-pr --status-only` fails with `Permission denied`. During the run, one owner ran it through `bun` instead. That call hit a JSON parse retry loop that did not reproduce later, and the owner fell back to `gh api`. **Fix.** Copy the source mode with `shutil.copymode`, and add a test that every built file keeps its vendor mode.
3. **`no-comments` names no pstack role for Comment Sicko.** Step 1 of `t3/overrides/no-comments/SKILL.md` (line 19) gives the T3 task role `review` and no role to resolve the target from. Three owners chose three different seats for the same step: `judgment and prose` on Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Haiku 4.5 picked by hand without `roles.py`, and Grok 4.7 Build Fast. One owner wrote that "the skill specifies review without a pstack name". **Fix.** Name the pstack role that seats Comment Sicko in step 1, such as `judgment and prose`, and list it in the runtime's Role names table.
4. **`roles.py show` keeps only the last `--role`.** `t3/scripts/roles.py` declares `--role` without `action="append"` (line 600). `roles.py show --role "bug-fix" --role "judgment and prose"` prints only `judgment and prose` and gives no error. One owner asked for two roles and had to rerun the command. **Fix.** Accept repeated `--role` flags, or reject a repeat with an error.

### Observations that are not pstack-t3 defects

- **Fix rounds have no bound.** On #4 each round's live lane found a new, narrower edge case in number parsing, and the playbook sends every proven finding back to the owner. Nothing in step 4 weighs a finding against the issue's scope, so a small command line had taken four rounds by the end of the record. The rule is upstream's.
- **The design pass costs more than the change.** poteto-mode sends any code that crosses a function boundary to the architect skill. The #4 owner ran five architect runners for a 69-line command line. The slowest runner ran for about 12 minutes, from 11:19:52 to 11:31:52 UTC. The design pass, from that runner's start to the owner's launch of its implementation child at 11:36:41 UTC, took about 17 minutes. Three owners noted the tension with the 15-minute deadline for a first PR. The rule is upstream's, so a change belongs upstream.
- **A watch wake does not name the head.** The stored wake text is `#5: checks passed`. One wake arrived after a rebase, and the owner read it as news about the old head. The runtime's rule that a wake is news held, because the owner re-read the PR before merging.
- **The root settled between turns.** T3 settled the idle root after it launched the last owner. The next `t3_thread_send` and the hourly tick both still woke it. The root held no watch, so settling cost nothing.
